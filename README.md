# DD2480-group9-lab2-CI

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13** (no external libraries required)

### Testing

- A **test suite** in `/test` verifies the correctness of each LIC function and the final decision logic.
- Run the tests with:
  ```sh
  python -m unittest discover test
  ```


## Workflow
Throughout the project, issues were created and assigned to all parts of the program, ensuring clarity in development tasks. The goals for the lab were structured into milestones, allowing for systematic progress tracking.

All implementation was done in separate branches, each linked to at least one issue. Before merging any changes into the `main` branch, at least two team members reviewed the modifications to maintain code quality and consistency.

Commits should be structured following the format: `typeprefix(function or file): description #issue`, where `typeprefix` could be one of the following:
- `feat`: Introducing a new feature.
- `fix`: Fixing a bug.
- `docs`: Documentation updates.
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests.
- `refactor`: Code restructuring or improvements without changing functionality.

`function or file` refers to what part of the code base that is addressed and `#issue` refers to what issue this commit relates to if applicable.
This workflow ensured an organized and efficient development process.
